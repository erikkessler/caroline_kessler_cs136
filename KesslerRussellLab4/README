This directory contains the minimum starter file for MyVector.java and
Student.java.

When you are finished with this lab, you should turn in MyVector.java,
Student.java, an implementation of one or more Comparator classes,
and a program that reads the phone book from the input and answers some
pressing question using your Comparator applied to students.

pb is the resident student phone book.  Each student is represented by
three lines:

Aamir U Wyne
Poker Flats B5
4135973427 3334 5406394821

The first line is the name of the student, the second is their campus
address, and the third contains the campus phone, su box, and home phone.

Questions, useful for testing:
1.  Which student appears first in a printed phone book?
2.  Which students share the most-shared phones?
3.  Which student has the smallest SU box?  Largest?
4.  What is the ranking of area codes of home phones, in decreasing order
    of Williams population density?
